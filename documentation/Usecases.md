# Use cases

Billy is walking in the supermarket trying to figure out what to make for dinner. He goes online to find on of his
recipes that he has created. He first sees an overview of all recipes he has created in the past. For selecting a dinner
recipe, Billy can select recipes by the category of 'dinner'. He narrows down the choices further by reviewing the list
he made called 'dinner by himself' and found something he likes.

He selects the detail page of the recipe he chooses and is redirected to the recipe page with all ingredients needed
and the instructions. By default, the recipe shows the amount of ingredients for a four person meal. Since Billy
is alone however, he changes the the amount of persons to two, as he may be alone but is still quite hungry! This
changes the amount of what is needed from each ingredient to the right proportions.
